# OKRs for Smart People

*This is the outline of a presentation I put together in 2008, when trying to standardize the OKR process across an organization of ~250 people.*

*A decade later I have patches I need to apply, but in the meantime folks I know have found the current version useful so I'm sharing it here.*

---
## There are only two types of goal-setting frameworks: the kind that everybody hates, and the kind that nobody uses.
---

## Why are we here?

We love OKRs:
* **Disciplined thinking**

   The major goals will surface and the big picture not be forgotten
   
* **Accurate communication**

   Lets everyone know and agree on what's important
   
* **Established indicators for measuring progress**

   Shows how far along we are, where we’ve been and where we’re going
   
* **Focused effort towards a common goal**

   Keeps organizations in step and in sync with each other. Any disconnects are surfaced early

## OKRs are a tool to improve what we do as an organization
---

## Objectives

Defining objectives:

* High-level statements of a goal you are trying to accomplish

* **Perhaps visionary**

  e.g., “Create a radical new market system for machine allocation”
  
* **Maybe perpetual**

  e.g., “Improve our users’ experience with maps and geographic information”
  
* **Likely not achievable in one quarter**

* **A direction which orients and guides all the other actions you take** and work you do

---
## Objectives may, and likely should, span many quarters
---

## Key Results

Defining Key Results:

* **Measurable achievements** which you could accomplish in a quarter

  Don’t include key results which can’t be measured

* **Metrics and deadlines** should be included in each Key Result

  *e.g., “Launch product X and reach Ym users by end of January”*

* Some Key Results may be deliberately **stretching** and marked as such

## Execution

Delivery of Key Results should be deliberate and planned:

* **Accidental** or **incidental** delivery is **not sufficient**

  e.g., if your key result is “grow traffic by 50%” then you should make explicit plans to grow it rather than just look back at the end of the quarter and see if it happened or not

* Consider creating a **delivery plan** for the Key Result when defining it

* **Assign people** to tasks involved in delivery of a Key Result

* Add a **single accountable owner** to each Key Result

* Ideally the impact of a Key Result would be **sustainable** and **lasting**

## Defining OKRs

Remember:

* Your Objectives should **align directly** with your **team’s mission**

* Your Key Results should be **framed in terms of business or product**

  * **Avoid** creating an implementation task list

  * The **value of the result** should be clear in the context of the objective

  * Delivery of the result should be **within the team’s control**

  * The Key Result should **make sense, without explanation**, to a reviewer outside the team

    *Old and busted*: “Register all torso objs in the object registry and migrate to BT”
  
    *New hotness*: “Complete migration to an enhanced and more flexible platform”

* Consider including **operational results**

---
## There will be stuff you do which isn’t in your OKRs. It’s OK.
---

## Scoring OKRs

Guidelines:

* At the end of the quarter, teams should be able to look at each Key Result and assign a **numerical score** measuring the accomplishment Key Results may be scored on a continuous or discrete basis

* As appropriate, scores should be **validated with stakeholders**

* Objectives may **carry over** to subsequent quarters Missed Key Results may be reformulated for a subsequent quarter
